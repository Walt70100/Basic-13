# Basic-13
Here's another example of a simple BASIC code that calculates and prints the first N terms of the arithmetic sequence.

In this code:

- The program prompts the user to enter the first term of the arithmetic sequence (a1), the common difference (d), and the number of terms (N) using the INPUT command.
- It initializes a loop variable A1 with the first term.
- It uses a FOR loop to calculate and print the first N terms of the arithmetic sequence.
- Inside the loop, it adds the common difference (d) to the current term (A1) to calculate the next term.
- The loop continues until it reaches the specified number of terms (N).
- Finally, it prints a newline character to separate the sequence from any subsequent output.

This code demonstrates how to use loops and variables to generate and print an arithmetic sequence in BASIC.
